## Use Case
User will start by searching for a city that they are interesting in visiting. The results will show a list of popular tourist attractions with information including rating, reviews, address, phone number, and a link to more yelp reviews will populate. 

From here, the user can add items to their _Bucket List_. If they are interested in visiting somewhere that is not listed within the initial search results, they can search for a specific attraction or conduct a general search such as "pizza". 

While building their _Bucket List_, the user can add/remove items as well as edit the descriptions/add comments about each attraction. 

Once user is happy with their _Bucket List_, they can **See my trip!**. This will take them to a new page that has all their _Bucket List_ items listed out with information including and comments that they added. This page will also include a Google Map with markers at the location of all the places saved to their _Bucket List_.
